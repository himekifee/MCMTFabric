# MCMTFabric - Minecraft Multi-Threading Mod Fabric Port
This mod is based on the amazing work on [JMT-MCMT](https://github.com/jediminer543/JMT-MCMT). Please check that repository for technical details. For those who want to understand how this magic works, I recommend reading my source since I read from MCMT and that one is full of asm engineering which is not noob(like me) friendly. Feel free to ask any question on discord. No plan for making another discord server so let's just use MCMT's one. 

[cloth-config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) is needed as a dependency.

If you want to send me some milk tea(I don't really like coffee) please send some xmr to `88R8LWHX7jj5zkC3iz88U29yDFAhdgKdQTbViPsbeVDvS6rHS6UTkR6WWqEDgkg8UjeorRDdD5uenBLgCHXxboVb8BTdpzH`. Happy playing!
